# ANA-lyst

This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of the paper 
"A Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Complex Pattern Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) Analysis with Titer Levels Recognition".

To address the critical limitations of existing ANA analysis methodologies, we introduce ANAlyst.
(1) A binary negativity-positivity classifier filters out negative samples; 
(2) Positive samples undergo multi-task analysis for complex patterns classification and complex titer classification.


## Quickstart

Run the ANA-lyst:

```
python run.py --image_file $IMAGE FILE$
```
